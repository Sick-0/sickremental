Incremental cookieclicker style game toi self improve on my react knowledge base.

## the idea
having an incremental game where you upgrade through the stages of evolution.
You will have the default clicker as well as upgrades, once you achieve enough evolution points to transit to the next stage you will reset back to 1.

### starting grounds
One cell life just trying to get by.

 - *CLICKER* = One Cell
 - *Upgrade 1* = Sunlight
 - *Upgrade 2* = Easy Food
 - *Upgrade 3* = Currents
 - *Upgrade 4* = Collaboration
 - *Lucky Event* = Meteor
 - *Unlucky Event* = Volcanic clouds

### Early Ocean life
MULTICELL life collaborating to success.

- *CLICKER* = MULTI Cell
- *Upgrade 1* = Lets get together 
- *Upgrade 2* = Divide and conquer
- *Upgrade 3* = Tight Clusters
- *Upgrade 4* = Specialisations
- *Lucky Event* = Life Burst
- *Unlucky Event* = Separatist 

### Early Ocean life II
Plant and shell life.

- *CLICKER* = Plant with snail?
- *Upgrade 1* = Greens
- *Upgrade 2* = Shells
- *Upgrade 3* = Growth
- *Upgrade 4* = Nutrients
- *Lucky Event* = Hot waters
- *Unlucky Event* = Harsh winter

### and so on trough stages, first two for testing then test increment with place holders

//TODO: 
- Random (un)lucky events -> needs animation, refactor and removed
- stage 3 HOW SMOOTH IS IT
